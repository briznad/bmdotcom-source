a w i n d o w is a new retail concept and creative studio based in NYC which aims at finding new and unique ways of creating, presenting and consuming design and bringing back the excitement and surprise to the shopping experience. We create traveling, sculptural retail installations that resemble storefront window displays, “stores in a box”, which in itself are beautiful design objects that function as a store, act as filters and allow people to take their time to appreciate them.

The store as a design object.

The installations consist of collections of limited edition, bespoke art, fashion and design objects that collectively explore an idea and are created in collaboration with artists and designers who are at the forefront of the art and design worlds.

Founders Mariana Vidal Escabi and Diego Cristancho believe that good design needs time to develop, but also needs time to be appreciated. It’s easy to lose the excitement of discovering new ideas, objects and artists in an oversaturated and hyper-connected market. Mariana is a designer with a background in fashion, textiles, concept and color design and is the Creative Director of this project, while Diego is a digital marketing executive whose business acumen and digital prowess has been invaluable to the project.
