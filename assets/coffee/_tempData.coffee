      "description": "We live in a world where anything can be right at our fingertips the moment we want it. While this has made so much of life more convenient, it has also made it easy to see everything as disposable. Things become too easy to replace and suddenly objects lose any sense of intimacy or excitement. It’s easy to drown in the forgettable, the factory-made and easily replaceable, and forget how it feels to be surprised by something special. <br/>For the first edition of a window titled “Subtleties and Nuances”, we wanted to explore the power of quiet beauty and understated elegance. That sense of unspoken mystery that suddenly makes the unattainable overwhelmingly desirable. The way a double take or the need for participation makes a message, an experience, even an object more powerful.<br/>Referencing camouflage, reflection and trompe l’oiel, this collection is inspired by glimpses, hidden shadows and objects that speak louder because they force you to listen. Nothing here is easy to pass by or easy to replace. For the installation, we wanted to explore the juxtaposition of intimacy and surprise – the objects appear frozen mid-fall, but on closer inspection are woven in an intricate grid inside a perforated plexiglass box. <br/>ÉKLEIPSIS, an oversized pearl bracelet with a strange shadow marking, is our first exploration of that mysterious intimacy. The bracelet, designed by Dean Sidaway, is made by flocking the pearls in black. What that black shadow is, and who casts it, may be up to the wearer but its appearance forces us to rethink that a pearl bracelet, a symbol of elegance and femininity, should look like with a literal interruption of the classic design. Meanwhile, Neil Gilks’ CORE and CONKER is an articulation of quiet beauty through familiar objects translated into precious materials. CONKER is based on a traditional British game in which two players make a hole in chestnut conkers, tie shoelaces through them and attempt to break the others’ conker first. CORE celebrates the beauty of a discarded object, the exposed core of an apple, giving it a new light in pure silver.<br/>Quoc Lieu’s SKULL is a more intellectual take on a familiar motif. The oversize silver tubing ring has been molded by hand into the shape of a skull, then coated in white enamel paint until the only visible color remains in the brain cavity. DOUBLE TONGUE also explores the interaction of accessory and anatomy. The belted leather bracelet, designed by Wes Carnes, features a mirrored buckle and an unusual “tongue”, while Daniel Reynolds’ T-SHIRT at first seems to be a mysterious leather piece, but unfolds to become a wearable, minimal hand painted leather t-shirt.<br/>Lastly, SQUARE is a sample of Neil Gilks’ pillow designs that explore unusual materials including plastic bags, silver mylar and fishing rod. Gilks crafted these surprising materials into beautiful and naïve embroideries that make the pillows more art pieces than household items.<br/><br/>Many thanks to Carlos Rocha, Olivier Gregoire, Carlos Meza, Fabienne Hess, Hellen Bullock, Juan Chami, Martin Huberman, Jenna Drumright and Gayle Smith who helped us so much along the way. Without them, this edition would not had been possible. <br/>",

When staring deeply into his computer screen he might be thinking through a complex layer of abstraction, attempting to coax data models into elegant forms. Or he might just be fussing over a button color. He looks forward to a time when all apps and websites are clear, concise, and pretty, even though that means he’d be out of a job.",

      "description": "Quoc Lieu was born in Vietnam and grew up in Oakland, California. Quoc always had an interest in design and construction and from an early age would take apart broken toys to see how they fit together, then later rebuild them. It wasn't until high school that his passion became focused on fashion and jewelry design. Upon graduating from the Academy of Art University in San Francisco, Quoc moved to New York where he has worked in the fashion industry for the last 13 years. Never moving too far from his love of jewelry design, he creates unique and meticulously handcrafted jewelry inspired by everything from pushpins to plastic doilies to hornets’ nests. <br/>www.etsy.com/shop/MRLIEU ",

Though born in Virginia, Wes recently moved his tiny studio from the East Village to Brooklyn in order to produce samples and collections for designers such as Sophie Theallet and Rebecca Minkoff. His work has been featured in several magazines including Interview, Elle, and Vogue. He reluctantly admits to having been a model for several years, will admit to being a decent musician and a terrible actor. <br/>www.cwcleather.com",

      "description": "“It is said that in antiquity a window was created not to let light in a room but to reduce the field of observation to a detail and thus concentrate the gaze. This kind of frame both limited the perspective and created it in the first place”.<br/>Fresh Widow: The Window in Art since Matisse and Duchamp<br/><br/>awindow is a creative studio that aims to find new and unique ways of navigating the visual landscape in a world that has become oversaturated with information and products. With our work, we want to explore new and more thoughtful ways of creating, presenting and consuming design.<br/>Our first project is an enclosed gallery resembling a storefront window display. By framing the gaze, this boxed quality draws the viewer’s attention directly to the collection of objects, placing as much attention on the process of creation as the final outcome. Each object is designed independently, but with the purpose of collectively exploring an idea.<br/><br/>awindow is meant as a nomad piece, appearing in different places throughout the city with biannual editions that can only be purchased through a digital platform. This addresses both our interest in the power of an experience and object that is not immediately accessible, and the present coexistence of online and offline worlds. In a noisy retail market, this is a restrained and elegant shopping experience that provides a sense of discovery and surprise for the design-minded. Even beyond that, the entire installation becomes an object of design in itself and another piece in the collection. As such, the installation will also be available for purchase as a collector’s item.<br/><br/>Founders Mariana Vidal Escabi and Diego Cristancho believe that good design needs time to develop, but also needs time to be appreciated. It’s easy to lose the excitement of discovering new ideas, objects and artists in an oversaturated and hyperconnected market. Mariana is a designer with a background in fashion, textiles, concept and color design and is the Creative Director of this project, while Diego is a digital marketing executive whose business acumen and digital prowess has been invaluable to the project.",
